            <h3 class="titles-bio">Early Life</h3>
            <p>Greene grew up in Los Angeles and attended the University of California, Berkeley, before finishing his degree at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison with a B.A. degree in classical studies. Prior to becoming an author, Greene estimates that he worked about 50 jobs, including as a construction worker, translator, magazine editor, and Hollywood movie writer. In 1995, Greene worked as a writer at Fabrica, an art and media school in Italy, and met a book packager named Joost Elffers. Greene pitched a book about power to Elffers and wrote a treatment which eventually became The 48 Laws of Power. He would note this as the turning point of his life.</p>

            <p>Greene lives in Los Angeles with his wife Anna Biller, who is a filmmaker. Greene can speak five languages and is a student of Zen Buddhism. Greene is a mentor for Ryan Holiday, bestselling author of Trust Me, I'm Lying, The Obstacle Is the Way, Ego Is the Enemy, and The Daily Stoic. Greene supported Barack Obama in the 2012 United States presidential election and identifies with liberal politics. Greene says Donald Trump misunderstands power. When asked in 2012 if he is religious, Greene said "I'm Jewish but I don't have a hardcore spiritual practice. I'm not hardcore Atheist; I'm sort of how Einstein was: He wasn't a believer in the Jewish God. I'm intrigued by the sense that there's something there."Greene suffered a serious stroke before launching his new book The Laws of Human Nature in 2018. A bee sting that precipitated a blood clot in his neck caused the stroke, leaving Greene without the use of his left hand and leg for quite some time.</p>
