## User Experience

### Target Audience

The Master Yourself Website targets an audience of people interested in self-development, working mostly in business, politics or in social environments where people skills are fundamental. It aims as well at reaching anyone who is eager to learn more about Human Nature, to know oneself and the others thoroughly and ground their life and personal development in reality, past the pain and boredom of everyday life.

### User Stories

#### I want a clear overview of Greene books

I heard a lot about Greene books and I'd like to read one of them, but I do not know from which one to start. I want a website giving me a clear overview of all his books, so that I could decide which suits better to my taste.

#### Looking for valuable self-development books

I am a compulsive reader, especially of self development books. It is often difficult to find valuable books in the self development field, since many of them are written mostly for profit and give superficial life advices rather than practical life-hacks. Greene has a very good reputation in this field and I hope that the  Master Yourself Website will help me to understand if he is the writer that I am looking for.

#### Manager at Bank99 into self-development

I have recently been promoted as Manager. Being in a managerial position, it is fundamental for me to understand deeply the dynamics of power and human behaviour within my company. I will check the Master Yourself website to have an overview about The 48 Laws of Power of Robert Greene or other of his books. Many people say that this book is the final guide for anyone who has power or wants to arm against those in power.

#### Looking for a free eBook

I love reading but I do not have much money to buy books every month. I would like to see if there is any option to get a free eBook. Culture and knowledge should be for free to help our society to blossom.

## Design

### Color Scheme

The colors chosen for Master Yourself are black, metallic gold and cerulean blue. The first two recall the colors of the cover of Greene's book entitled "Mastery". Gold symbolizes wealth and prosperity, abundance and accomplishment throughout history, reminding that Greene's books are a mix of distilled wisdom from the biographies of mutliple successful historical characters. Black symbolizes elegance, power, restraint, fear, evil and occult. It represents how Greene's books take deeply into analysis the negative emotions of human beings, the dark side of human nature, but teaches as well how to control and master them for our own goals and wellbeing.
The color blue can be found only in the window on the index.html. Blue represents open spaces, imagination, the serenity and freedom that can come with wisdom and knowledge.

![Colour Scheme](./assets/images/readme_images/human_nature_colorpalette_readme.png)

### Typography

The Font chosen for the text on all the pages is Lora. Purpose of the font with the golden color is to be elegant, easy and pleasant to read. In the Newsletter section there is a live icon with a "jumping" book, that invites the visitor of the side to get the free eBook.

### Imagery

Images used in a page are photos of Robert Greene portraying him both in younger age - on the "Home" page - and as he looks today - on the "About the Author" page. On the pages "The Books" and "Get your free eBook" there are the captivating covers of his books.

### Wireframes

The wireframes for the "Master Yourself" website were created with Balsamiq.

## Features

### The dropdown navigation menu

The navigation menu can be accessed by clicking on the black round icon on the top left corner. When clicking or hovering on it each time - clicking for mobile version, hovering for the desktop version- the colors of the text and the background will reverse - from black to gold and from gold black - to facilitate the navigation.

![dropdown menu](./assets/images/readme_images/dropdown.png)

### The landing image

- In the landing image there is a younger Greene than his current age, who looks ambitious, clever and successful. The photo should mirror the personality of businessmen and politicians who would like to be like Robert Greene, or anyone aiming at self-developing.
- On the left of the image there is a blue cerulean window introducing the worldwide reputation of Robert Greene as modern Macchiavelli

![landing image](./assets/images/readme_images/landing_image.png)

- At the bottom of the Home page, under the paragraph "Why you should read the books of Robert Greene?", there is a YouTube video in which Greene talks about Human Nature. The scope of the video is for the visitors of the website to get acquainted with Greene and his passion and knowledge about Human Nature, and to encourage them to visit the other pages of the site.

![youtube video](./assets/images/readme_images/introduction_page.png)

![books page](./assets/images/readme_images/books_page.png)

### About the author page

In this page there is Greene with his cat and surrounded by books. This page wants to give some information about the life of the author and the photo with the pet conveys friendliness and familiarity with him. The books around him remind of his knowledge.

![author page](./assets/images/readme_images/author_page.png)

### Get your free eBook page

- Here the visitors have the opportunity to fill out a form to subscribe to our newsletter and get one of the books in eBook format. It is an option to promote free culture and knowledge for the sake of society and learning.
- On the photo of the page there are all the books of Greene. They look on a "homy" surface and some of them are used. The photo wants to give the idea to the visitors of the site that with "one-click" they can receive the free eBook and read it comfortably on the sofa of their home.

### Footer

- The footer allows to reach us on Facebook, X-Twitter, Youtube and Instagram, so that visitors can stay up-to-date with everything about Robert Greene and the publishing of his next books.

## Features left to implement

- Flip cards: in "The Books" page, we would like to modify the cover of the books to become flip cards. When the user would click on the cover, this should flip and each time give a new short quote extracted from the book on which the visitor clicked.
- Video page: we would like to add a Video page to the website, where new videos are published weekly about the teachings of Robert or his participation to public events
- ECommerce page: we would like to develop an ecommerce page to provide the hard copies of our books directly to the customers.
- Events page: we would like to create a page with the list of all the events to which Robert Greene will take part. Fans of Robert could buy their tickets to the event here and it would be a great opportunity to meet him in person.

## Testing

### HTML - W3C-Validator

The result of the W3C Validator is all correct, except of the lines below where I get the following green message: "Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values. "

<img src="./assets/images/readme_images/html_validation_index.png" alt="index.html" height="450px" width="700px">

<img src="./assets/images/readme_images/html_validation_books.png" alt="books.html" height="800px" width="650x">

<img src="./assets/images/readme_images/html_validation_author.png" alt="author.html" height="850px" width="650px">

<img src="./assets/images/readme_images/html_validation_freebok.png" alt="freebook.html" height="900px" width="600px">

The message is due to a slash at the end of the end tag, that I removed multiple times but then it is added again by the IDE automatically anytime I save the HTML page.

### CSS-Validator

No errors after checking the code with  W3C Jigsaw CSS Validator. There is just one warning visible in the screenshot below at the bottom. This is due to the imported Google fonts.

And the following the result for the mobile version.

![Lightouse-Mobile](./assets/images/readme_images/Lightouse_testing_Mobile.png)

### Form testing

The form has tested to ensure that it will not submit without the required fields being filled out - First Name, Last Name, Email-Address.

### Browser testing

The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari with no issues. On Firefox the dropdown menu and the Form - just on Mobile - do not work completely.

### Device testing

The Website was tested on various devices, OnePlusNord10, iPhone13 mini, Google developer tools - Galaxy Fold, iPhone 12 pro, iPad mini, MacBook -, Desktop and created for the following screen sizes: 320px, 576px, 768px, 992px and up

### Mentor, family and friends testing

My mentor, my family and friends checked the site and helped to identify bugs and get a feeling about how the user-experience is perceived by visitors of the site.

### Fixed bugs

**Dropdown menu not working properly on Mobiles**

- The dropdown menu was opening too quickly on mobile, and it was often redirecting to the Home page before having the time to select any of the other pages. This was because the dropdown hover fuction implemented in CSS works on desktop, but not on mobile where the hovering should be replaced by clicking.
- I was unsure what was the root cause, which of the elements to which I applied the CSS was the one provoking the issue.
- The issue was resolved by applying the CSS declaration "display:block" to all these elements as per line 97 of the CSS file.

**Images not loading on the pages "About the author" and "Get free eBook"**

- On the deployed version of the website, the images were not loading on the pages mentioned in the title.
- For the photo in the "About the author" page, I added a dot at the beginning of the url - src="./assets/images/robertGreeneCat.jpg" - and then the photo loaded successfully.  
- For the second photo in the "Get free eBook" page, I removed the mentioned dot and I changed the name of the file photo all lowercase - src=/assets/images/allthebooks.png . Then the loading worked out.

### Unfixed bugs

- Firefox Mobile: the form layout does not display completely as it should. As mentioned in the Browser testing, the dropdown menu does not work completely in Firefox.
