## User Experience

### Target Audience

The Master Yourself Website targets an audience of people interested in self-development, working mostly in business and politics, and anyone who is eager to learn more about Human Nature.

### User Stories

#### I want a clear overview of Greene books

As a fan of Greene, I want a website giving me a clear overview of all his books.

### Looking for valuable self-development books

I am a compulsive reader, especially of self development books. Often it is difficult to find really valuable books about this field. I hope to find great content on the Master Yourself Website.

### Looking for a free eBook

I love reading but I do not have much money to buy books every month. I would like to see if there is any option to get a free eBook. Culture and knowledge should be for free to improve our society.

## Design

### Color Scheme

The colors chosen for Master Yourself are black and metallic gold. They want to remind the colors of the book of Greene called "Mastery". Gold symbolizes wealth and prosperity, abundance and accomplishment throught history, reminding that Greene's books are a mix of distilled wisdom from the biographies of mutliple successful historical characters. Black symbolizes elegance, power, restraint, fear, evil and occult. It represents how Greene's books take deeply into analysis the so-called negative emotions of human beings, their dark side, but teaches as well how to control and master them for our own goals.
