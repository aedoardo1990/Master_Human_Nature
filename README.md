## User Experience

### Target Audience

The Master Yourself Website targets an audience of people interested in self-development, working mostly in business, politics or social and working environments where people skills are fundamental. It aims as well at reaching anyone who is eager to learn more about Human Nature, to know oneself and the others thoroughly and ground their life and personal development in reality, past the pain and boredom of everyday life.

### User Stories

#### I want a clear overview of Greene books

I heard a lot about Greene books and I'd like to read one of them, but I do not from which one to start. I want a website giving me a clear overview of all his books, so that I could decide which suits better to my taste.

#### Looking for valuable self-development books

I am a compulsive reader, especially of self development books. It is often difficult to find valuable books in the self development field, since many of them are written mostly for profit and give superficial life advices rather than practical life-hacks. Greene has a very good reputation in this field and I hope that the  Master Yourself Website will help me to understand if he is the writer that I am looking for.

#### Manager at Bank99 into self-development

I have recently been promoted as Manager. Being in a managerial position, it is fundamental for me to understand deeply the dynamics of power and human behaviour within my company. I will check the Master Yourself website to have an overview about The 48 Laws of Power of Robert Greene or other of his books. Many people say that this book is the final guide for anyone who has power or wants to arm against those in power.

#### Looking for a free eBook

I love reading but I do not have much money to buy books every month. I would like to see if there is any option to get a free eBook. Culture and knowledge should be for free to help our society to blossom.

## Design

### Color Scheme

The colors chosen for Master Yourself are black, metallic gold and cerulean blue. They recall the colors of the book of Greene called "Mastery". Gold symbolizes wealth and prosperity, abundance and accomplishment throughout history, reminding that Greene's books are a mix of distilled wisdom from the biographies of mutliple successful historical characters. Black symbolizes elegance, power, restraint, fear, evil and occult. It represents how Greene's books take deeply into analysis the negative emotions of human beings, the dark side of human nature, but teaches as well how to control and master them for our own goals and wellbeing.
The color blue can be found only in the window on the index.html. Blue represents open spaces, imagination, the serenity and freedom that can come with wisdom and knowledge.
On the Get Free EBook page the "get your ebook" button becomes green when the form is submitted to confirm that it is the correct action to get the book.

## w3c-validator

The W3C Validator is all correct, except of the lines 4,5,6,8,12,18 where I get the following green message.

Info: Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values.

The message is due to a slash at the end of the end tag, that I removed multiple times but then it is added by the IDE automatically anytime I save the HTML page.
