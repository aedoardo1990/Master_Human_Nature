          secrets of the field you have chosen, submit to a rigorous
          apprenticeship, absorb the hidden knowledge possessed by those with
          years of experience, surge past competitors to surpass them in
          brilliance, and explode established patterns from within. Study the
          behaviors of Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin, Leonardo da Vinci and
          the nine contemporary Masters interviewed for this book.

          We are social animals. Our very lives depend on our relationships with
          people. Knowing why people do what they do is the most important tool
          we can possess, without which our other talents can only take us so
          far. Drawing from the ideas and examples of Pericles, Queen Elizabeth
          I, Martin Luther King Jr, and many others, Greene teaches us how to
          detach ourselves from our own emotions and master self-control, how to
          develop the empathy that leads to insight, how to look behind people's
          masks, and how to resist conformity to develop your singular sense of
          purpose. Whether at work, in relationships, or in shaping the world
          around you, The Laws of Human Nature offers brilliant tactics for
          success, self-improvement, and self-defense.

          Amoral, cunning, ruthless, and instructive, this piercing work distils
          three thousand years of the history of power into forty-eight
          well-explicated laws. As attention-grabbing in its design as it is in
          its content, this bold volume outlines the laws of power in their
          unvarnished essence, synthesizing the philosophies of Machiavelli,
          Sun-tzu, Carl von Clausewitz, and other great thinkers. Some laws
          require prudence ("Law 1: Never Outshine the Master"), some stealth
          ("Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions"), and some the total absence of
          mercy ("Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally"), but like it or not, all
          have applications in real-life situation. ations. Illustrated through
          the tactics of Queen Elizabeth I, Henry Kissenger, P T Barnum, and
          other famous figures who have wielded - or been victimised by - power,
          these laws will fascinate any reader interested in gaining, observing
          or defending against ultimate control.

          Thatcher and Hannibal to Ulysses S. Grant, as well as diplomats,

          them in Suspense – What Comes Next” and “Master the Art of the Bold
          Move”. Every bit as essential as The 48 Laws of Power, The Art of

          The Daily Laws offers a page of refined and concise wisdom for each
          day of the year, in an easy-to-digest lesson that will only take a few
          minutes to absorb. Each day features a Daily Law as well—a
          prescription that readers cannot afford to ignore in the battle of
          life. Each month centers around a major theme: power, seduction,
          persuasion, strategy, human nature, toxic people, self-control,
          mastery, psychology, leadership, adversity, or creativity. Who doesn’t
          want to be more powerful? More in control? The best at what they do?
          The secret: Read this book every day. “Daily study,” Leo Tolstoy wrote
          in 1884, is “necessary for all people.” More than just an introduction
          for new fans, this book is a Rosetta stone for internalizing the many
          lessons that fill Greene’s books and will reward a lifetime of reading
          and rereading.
